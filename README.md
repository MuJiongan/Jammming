# Jammming
This is a react app that interacts with spotify's API, allowing users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

[Deployed using surge](https://reactsavetoplaylistjamming.surge.sh/)

I made it with the knowledge of react components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API.
